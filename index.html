        <h3>Early life and career</h3>
        <p class="anjali-para">
          Sharma is a high school student from Melbourne, who took the
          Australian federal government, and Minister for the Environment,
          Sussan Ley, to the Federal Court of Australia in a class action. She
          was the lead litigant, together with seven other school students, and
          a nun, Sister Marie Brigid Arthur. The class action asked the Federal
          Court to stop Minister for the Environment, Ley from approving an
          expansion to the coalmine Vickery, near Gunnedah, in NSW. The Federal
          Court ruled, in a world first, that the Minister for the Environment
          was required to have a duty of care towards teenagers and children,
          with respect to climate change impacts, and in particular bushfire and
          heatwave impacts. This set a precedent for following court cases. The
          Court of Justice, Justice Mordecai Bromberg, ruled that the Minister
          for the Environment had a "duty of care" to not harm the youth or
          their future. He ruled that the Minister had "a duty to take
          reasonable care to avoid causing personal injury" to youth and
          children of Australia, when the Minister for the Environment, made a
          decision about the extension of the coal mining project under the
          legislation, Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
          [1999].[3] The aim, as stated by the teenagers, was to stop or prevent
          the expansion of future fossil fuel projects in the future.Weather
          Report was an American jazz fusion band active from 1970 to 1986. The
          band was founded (and initially co-led) by Austrian keyboard player
          Joe Zawinul, American saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and Czech bassist
          Miroslav Vitouš. Other prominent members at various points in the
          band's lifespan included Jaco Pastorius, Alphonso Johnson, Victor
          Bailey, Chester Thompson, Peter Erskine, Airto Moreira, and Alex
          Acuña. Throughout most of its existence, the band was a quintet
          consisting of Zawinul, Shorter, a bass guitarist, a drummer, and a
          percussionist.
